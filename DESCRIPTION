Description: The 'zlib' package for R aims to offer an R-based equivalent of 'Python's' built-in 'zlib' module for data compression and decompression. This package provides a suite of functions for working with 'zlib' compression, including utilities for compressing and decompressing data streams, manipulating compressed files, and working with 'gzip', 'zlib', and 'deflate' formats.
